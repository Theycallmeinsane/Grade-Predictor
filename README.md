The provided code conducts predictions for the percentages of different semesters based on the subjects taken. Here's a summary:

Data Preprocessing:

Missing values in the features are handled using mean imputation.
Data scaling is performed using MinMaxScaler to bring features to a similar scale.
Data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Model Building:

Sequential neural network models are constructed using Keras.
Each model consists of several dense layers with different activation functions.
Mean Squared Error (MSE) is chosen as the loss function, and Adam optimizer is used for model compilation.
Model Training:

Models are trained using the training data for a certain number of epochs with specified batch sizes.
Training progress is printed for each model.
Model Evaluation:

Predictions are made on the test data.
MSE is calculated between the actual and predicted values for each semester.
Results are printed, and scatter plots showing the actual vs. predicted values are plotted for each semester.
Summary:

The process is repeated for each semester, from Semester 2 to Semester 8.
The models seem to be performing reasonably well, as evidenced by the scatter plots and MSE values.
Further analysis could involve fine-tuning hyperparameters or trying different architectures to potentially improve performance.
Overall, the code provides a comprehensive approach to predicting semester percentages based on subject scores, leveraging machine learning techniques effectively.
